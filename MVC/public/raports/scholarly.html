                <p> 
                    What Food is a Web application where you can find new recipes that belong to a variety 
                    of categories and where you can add your own recipes. The application offers all these
                    recipes to both users that have an account and users that don't (visitors). However,
                    only users that have an account can add new recipes.
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="scope"><span>2.1 </span>Scope</h3>
                <p>  
                    What Food is easy to use and accessible. This application is here to help those who are 
                    in need of cooking inspiration and to give a platform to people who love to cook and 
                    make new recipes. In order to use the application, all you have to do is access its 
                    link and either browse recipes or add new ones.
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="conventions"><span>2.2 </span>Conventions</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to adding a new recipe, a connected user only has to go to the feed page,
                    click the Add Recipe button which will then redirect them to the add recipe page where
                    they must put all the characteristics of the recipe they want to add. After that, they
                    only have to click on the Submit Recipe button. When the user clicks on the logo of
                    every page, they will be redirected either to the feed page or the settings page, 
                    depending on the page that they are currently on. The same thing happens for connected 
                    users whenever they click on their avatar photo at the top of the navbar. All our social 
                    media links (FaceBook, Instagram, Twitter), as well as the link to our terms and policy 
                    can be found in the footer of every page on the application.
                </p>

                <h3 id="productScope"><span>2.3 </span>Product role</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this website is to help people find and share new recipes. Users can either
                    make an account and be able to access some extra features (such as posting a recipe, show 
                    the fact that the user has tried a certain recipe by posting a photo of the final product and
                    access to a user page where the user can see the recipes that they posted and the ones that 
                    they tried) or use the website without having to register (they will only be able to find
                    new recipes).
                </p>

                <h3 id="references"><span>2.4 </span>References</h3>           
                <p>
                    In order to make the application's user interface as accessible as possible, we 
                    documented a few important and helpful websites that helped us in the web development
                    process.

            <h3 id= "productPerspective"> <span>3.1 </span>Product Perspective</h3>
            <p>
               This product offers a wider range of options and capabilities than other recipe Web applications 
               (such as AllRecipes for example). Admin users can delete and modify all the other recipes and users. 
               We have a wider variety of categories. The application offers the possiblity of filtering the default
               recipes and the search results by a few specifications. Users have a big variety of search parameters.
            </p> 

            <h3 id= "productFunctions"> <span>3.2 </span>Functions</h3>
            <p>  
                The application has many functionalities. Users can make an account or navigate as a visitor. 
                Connected users can add their own recipes, try existing recipes, see their search history, 
                all the recipes they added and the ones they tried. Admin users have access to all recipes and 
                users and can modify and delete users and recipes. Visitors can see the default recipes (by clicking
                the home button on the feed page), they can do search and they can see the rankings.
            </p>

            <h3 id= "classesAndCharacteristics"> <span>3.3 </span>User Categories</h3>
            <p>
                What Food is the perfect Web application for people who love to cook and either need to 
                find some new recipes to try or want to share their recipes with other people. However,
                our product serves 3 types of clients/users: visitors, who are users that don't have an 
                account and have limited privileges, normal users who have access to all the application's 
                function other than the admin functionality and admin users who have the same privilege 
                as normal user but they also have almost unlimited access to all the recipes and all the users 
                in our database.
            </p>
         
            <h3 id= "operationEnvironment"> <span>3.4 </span>Operation Environment </h3>
            <p>              
                As What Food is a Web application, it can be opened on any browser that supports HTML, CSS 
                and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h3 id= "designConstrains"> <span>3.5</span> Design Constrains </h3>
            <p>              
                Although our product has a wide range of functionalities, it also has some limitations. When 
                it comes to searching, users can either search by one parameter or by 2 and one of them has to 
                be the wanted ingredients. Rankings can only be exported as CSV or JSON. The instructions 
                for a recipe must not extend a certain amount of characters (however that amount is a
                fairly big one).
            </p>

            <h3 id= "userDocumentation"> <span>3.6 </span>User Documentation</h3>
            <p>              
                The terms and policy page is meant to help our clients get to know us, understand our 
                mission, their responsibility as users and exactly what data we collect from them, if 
                they register. The landing page is the page where the user decides what type of client they
                want to be (if they want to register and then login or if they just want to be a visitor
                on the application and navigate).

            <p>
                The application uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) in order to facilitate the 
                functions provided to the user.

                When it comes to the relation and communication between the client and the server, 
                What Food uses the HTTP protocol.

                For every user that we have, every user (regardless if they have an account or not) can

                on the website. However, users that have made an account have a few privileges. First of 
                all, all users can see all the recipes that have been added and they can sort them based 
                on popularity, prepping time, total time, most recent, difficulty and alphabetically. 
                Other than that, all users can see all the recipe categories and all the recipes belonging 
                to a category of their choosing. When it comes to adding a new recipe, only users that have 
                an account can do this. All users can see 3 types of rankings: top 10 most popular recipes, 
                top 10 most popular ingredients and top 10 most avoided ingredients. And not only can they 
                see these rankings but they can also export them as CSVs and JSONs. Other than that, 
                all users can search for a certain recipe, certain ingredients that they want, prepping 
                time, total time, ingredients that they don't want, recipe difficulty and recipe category. 
                Not only that but they can also sort the resulted recipes by popularity, prepping and 
                total time and by difficulty. A few other things that are provided are log out for 
                connected users, going to the settings page by clicking either on our logo or on the 
                user's avatar (if they have an account) and going to the terms and policy page by 
                clicking the link in the footer.

                On this page, all users (regardless if they have an account or not) can see some 
                information about this website and about us. You can see how you can use this website, 
                what you can and cannot do on it, what your responsilities as a user are and what

            <p>
                There are 3 types of users that can use our website, each with different privileges: 
                visitors (users that don't have an account), admins and normal users.
                Admins have a series of extra privileges from the normal users. They can see all the 
                recipes ever added on the website, modify and delete them (even if 
                they didn't add them), they can see all the users that have an account, modify their 
                information and delete their accounts, they can disconnect (logout) all connected 
                users, make other normal users admins and set the maximum number of ingredients and 
                instructions that users can add to a recipe.
